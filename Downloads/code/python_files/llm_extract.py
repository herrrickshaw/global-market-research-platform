llm_extract.py
==============
Generic "unstructured document -> structured JSON" extraction, using the
repo's existing Groq (OpenAI-compatible) LLM pattern (see repo-inventory/
canonicalize.py) with a Gemini fallback -- both already configured via
~/.env.local for the "AI Advisor" feature.

Derived from patents MY269019 "System and method for generating queryable
structured document from an unstructured document using machine learning"
(IIIT-Hyderabad, LTRC) and MY269128 "System for extracting and analyzing
nutritional information from food labels using a large language model"
(IIIT-Hyderabad, MLL) -- same core technique (unstructured text -> a fixed
schema via an LLM), applied here to two places in this repo that currently
rely on brittle regex/layout parsing:
  - SEBI DRHP filing text (SEBI_web_scraper.ipynb)
  - Portfolio broker-statement text (portfolio.py's PDF parsing)

Usage:
    from llm_extract import extract_structured

    schema = {
        "company_name": "string",
        "issue_size_cr": "number, issue size in INR crore",
        "price_band_low": "number",
        "price_band_high": "number",
        "listing_exchange": "string, e.g. NSE/BSE/both",
    }
    result = extract_structured(drhp_text, schema)

    Extract a JSON object matching *schema* out of unstructured *text* using
    an LLM. *schema* maps field name -> a short description of what to put
    there (used verbatim in the prompt, not validated as a JSON-schema spec --
    kept simple since every caller here just wants a flat field->value dict).

    require_citations (default True): also asks the model for a verbatim
    source-text span backing each non-null field, then verifies that span
    actually appears in *text* before trusting it -- citation-grounding, one
    of the few concretely effective mitigations in the literature on LLM
    extraction from financial documents. That literature is sobering: on
    FinanceBench (real 10-Ks/10-Qs/8-Ks), GPT-4-Turbo with retrieval got 81%
    of questions wrong; FinTagging found the best model only 17% accurate at
    linking extracted facts to correct XBRL taxonomy concepts. Single-shot
    "trust the JSON" extraction is not a safe default for this domain.

    Adds a "_grounding" key to the result: {field: {"grounded": bool, "span":
    str|None}}. An ungrounded field is NOT dropped from the result -- it's
    still returned as extracted -- but is flagged grounded=False so callers
    can decide whether to trust it (e.g. skip it, flag it for manual review,
    or log it). This catches the class of hallucination where the model
    invents a value with no textual basis in the document at all, which
    schema-only prompting (require_citations=False, the original behavior)
    can't catch.

    KNOWN LIMITATION, confirmed by testing: grounding only verifies the
    cited SPAN is real text copied from the document -- it does not verify
    that a COMPUTED/DERIVED value is actually correct given that span. E.g.
    asking for a "price_band_midpoint" (an arithmetic mean the model must
    calculate, not a literal quote) got grounded=True because the model
    correctly cited the real "Rs. 210 to Rs. 222" span -- but nothing here
    checks that 216 is actually the midpoint of 210 and 222. For
    computed/derived fields, add a separate correctness check (e.g.
    recompute simple arithmetic yourself from the grounded raw values rather
    than trusting the model's derived one).

    Falls back to *fallback_provider* if the primary provider's call or JSON
    parse fails, then raises if that fails too -- callers should catch and
    degrade gracefully (e.g. skip the field, don't crash a whole report).
