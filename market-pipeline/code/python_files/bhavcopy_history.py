# bhavcopy_history.py
# ===================
# Build ~1-year daily OHLCV history for the full NSE + BSE equity universe from
# the exchanges' OFFICIAL end-of-day bhavcopy files — no Yahoo Finance, so no
# rate limiting. Each daily bhavcopy is one CSV of every traded instrument; we
# download the last N calendar days (skipping weekends/holidays/missing), cache
# each raw file, then pivot into {symbol: OHLCV DataFrame} ready for the
# Darvas / Golden-Cross / volume screeners.
#
# Data sources (both use the 2025+ unified "F_0000" schema):
#   NSE  — via the `nse` library: NSE.equityBhavcopy(datetime)
#   BSE  — direct: BhavCopy_BSE_CM_0_0_0_<YYYYMMDD>_F_0000.CSV
#
# Unified columns used: TradDt, TckrSymb, SctySrs, FinInstrmTp,
#                       OpnPric, HghPric, LwPric, ClsPric, TtlTradgVol
#
# Caches raw CSVs under  ~/Downloads/data/bhavcopy_cache/{nse,bse}/<date>.csv
# so re-runs only fetch the newest missing day.

    instrument type, and that is the only reliable discriminator here:

        INE...  company equity          (2,389 NSE / 7,709 BSE)
