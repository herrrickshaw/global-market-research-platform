roace_by_liquidity.py — ROACE across large/mid/small cap, split by liquidity.

WHY THIS NEEDED A NEW COLLECTOR
-------------------------------
ROACE = EBIT / Capital Employed, where Capital Employed = Total Assets - Current
Liabilities. None of the existing fundamentals sources carry those inputs for India:

  market  route                      has EBIT?  why
  US      sec_fundamentals (EDGAR)   YES        real financial statements
  IN      Trendlyne -> screener.in   NO         header RATIOS only (pe/roe/d-e)
          -> yfinance .info          NO         .info has ebitda, not ebit+assets

So `cache_seed/fundamentals/IN.parquet` holds 525 rows of pe/roe/debt_to_equity and
ROACE was called impossible. It isn't: yfinance exposes `.income_stmt` and
`.balance_sheet` (NOT `.info`), which carry EBIT, Total Assets and Current
Liabilities directly, with ~5 years of history. Verified before building this:
    RELIANCE.NS  EBIT 1,472,180,000,000 / CE 16,368,860,000,000 = 9.0%
    TCS.NS       EBIT   667,140,000,000 / CE  1,214,580,000,000 = 54.9%
Both match their real-world ROCE (Reliance ~9-10%, TCS ~55% — asset-light IT).

An earlier attempt reconstructed capital employed from ratios
(equity = net_income/roe, assets = net_income/roa) and FAILED: cascading division
by small noisy denominators produced ROACE of 95-137% on a sample that collapsed
to 31 stocks. Read the statements; do not invert the ratios.

WHY LIQUIDITY-TIERED
--------------------
Fang, Noe & Tice (2009 JFE) find liquid firms have genuinely higher operating
returns on assets — liquidity tracks firm QUALITY. That is a separate claim from
returns, where Amihud (2002) finds illiquid stocks earn more. This script tests the
Fang/Noe/Tice half on Indian data: if they are right, ROACE should FALL as
liquidity falls.

Tiers are cut on median daily turnover from the 10.5y point-in-time OHLCV, so
"large/mid/small cap" here means liquidity-ranked, consistent with every other
gate in this repo, rather than a separate market-cap field that would disagree.

SAMPLING
--------
Each symbol costs 2 network calls, so the full 3,476-name universe is impractical
and pointless: a stratified sample answers "what is the ROACE profile per tier"
with a fraction of the calls. Sample size is per-tier and equal, so tiers are
directly comparable. Financial companies are NOT excluded here (see caveat in
main) — for banks/NBFCs capital employed is not meaningful, and they will show up
as outliers. Median is reported alongside mean for that reason.

    """ROCE for one symbol: latest, cash-adjusted, and its 5-year stability.

    THREE MEASURES, because ROCE alone answers less than it appears to:

    1. roace — EBIT / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities). The textbook figure.

    2. roace_ex_cash — the same with cash and short-term investments removed from
       capital employed. ROCE is DISTORTED BY LARGE CASH RESERVES: cash sits in
       Total Assets and inflates the denominator, so a cash-rich company posts an
       artificially depressed ROCE while looking capital-inefficient at nothing
       more than a strong balance sheet. Indian IT and pharma carry exactly this
       profile. Excess cash is not capital *employed* in the operating business,
       so removing it measures the operating engine rather than the treasury.

    3. roace_cv — coefficient of variation (sd/mean) of ROCE across every year of
       statements available (~5). A HIGH AND STABLE ROCE is the signal that
       management allocates capital well; a high but erratic ROCE is usually a
       cyclical peak being mistaken for skill. One year cannot distinguish them.
       LOWER cv = steadier. Reported alongside the level, never instead of it.

    Averaging note: this uses year-END capital employed, not the AVERAGE of
    opening and closing (the "A" in ROACE). yfinance gives ~5 annual snapshots, so
    a true average is available only for the overlapping years; year-end is the
    conventional simplification and is applied identically to every tier, so tier
    COMPARISONS stay valid even where a single company's level is slightly off.
