piotroski_plus.py — the canonical 9-point Piotroski F-score + a 3-point ROCE block.

WHY ADD ROCE TO PIOTROSKI AT ALL
--------------------------------
Because they measure different things, and this repo has the evidence rather than
just the intuition: across 288 Indian companies, spearman corr(ROCE, F-score) was
only **+0.236**. They are complements, not substitutes.

    Piotroski asks:  is this company getting BETTER this year? (a delta measure —
                     8 of its 9 tests are year-on-year changes or sign tests)
    ROCE asks:       does this company earn well on the capital it employs? (a
                     level measure, and over ~5y, a durability measure)

A firm can score 8/9 on Piotroski while earning 4% on capital — a turnaround off a
weak base. Another can earn 30% on capital with F=3 — a great business having a bad
year. Piotroski alone cannot tell you the first company is a poor business; ROCE
alone cannot tell you the second is deteriorating. Hence Plus.

DESIGN: THE 9 STAY INTACT AND SEPARABLE
---------------------------------------
The F-score is a published, validated construct with 30 years of literature behind
it. It is NOT modified, reweighted or reordered here. The ROCE block is a separate
0-3 that is reported alongside, so:
  * f_score stays comparable to every published Piotroski result, and
  * you can measure whether the Plus block ADDS anything, instead of taking it on
    faith. Fold ROCE into the 9 and both properties are lost forever.

THE ROCE BLOCK (0-3) — level, stability, trend
----------------------------------------------
  +1  roce_ex_cash > 15%      LEVEL      — earns well on capital actually employed
  +1  roce_cv      < 0.30     STABILITY  — sustained, not a cyclical peak
  +1  roce_latest >= 5y mean  TREND      — not quietly deteriorating

Level uses the EX-CASH figure deliberately. ROCE = EBIT/(TA - CL) leaves cash in the
denominator, so a cash-rich company posts a depressed ROCE and looks inefficient at
nothing more than a strong balance sheet. Measured on this repo's India sample the
distortion is large AND uneven: large caps hold 20.0% of capital employed in cash vs
9.5% for small caps, so the raw figure penalises exactly the companies that need it
least. Ex-cash measures the operating engine rather than the treasury.

Stability earns a point of its own because a high ROCE from a cyclical peak and a
high ROCE sustained for five years are opposite signals that look identical in a
single year. On this repo's sample the split was sharp: 64% of large caps and 66% of
mid caps held CV < 0.30, against 43% of small caps.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEASURE
--------------------------
ROCE is an accounting-earnings measure (EBIT) over an accounting denominator. It
says nothing about cash flow, revenue growth, or the ability to meet short-term
obligations — Piotroski's CFO tests (2 and 4) carry the cash-quality signal, and the
liquidity gate carries tradeability. Piotroski Plus is a QUALITY filter. It is not a
liquidity filter and must not be used as one: run it BEHIND the liquidity gate, never
instead of it.

DATA
----
Everything comes from yfinance `.income_stmt` / `.balance_sheet` / `.cashflow` — the
statements, NOT `.info`. `.info` carries ratios and ebitda but neither EBIT nor
assets, which is why India's existing fundamentals routes (Trendlyne, screener.in,
yfinance .info) never produced an F-score or a ROCE.

# vectors are how one scoring engine filters for different kinds of company:
# the tests never change, only what you are willing to pay for.
#
# score() returns the raw booleans; weights are applied afterwards by weigh().
# That separation is deliberate and load-bearing for backtesting — statements are
# fetched and tested ONCE, then any number of weight vectors are swept over the
# cached result. Folding weights into score() would mean a network round-trip per
# vector and make a sweep impractical.

    # not tell "a return you cannot rely on" from "a return capped by regulation".
    # Both scored F=7.0, so Piotroski could not either.
    # Tilting toward stability breaks the tie in the direction that reflects what
    # the level/stability split is FOR: a repeatable 10% is evidence of management
    # skill, an erratic 32% is usually evidence of a cycle. Callers who genuinely
